<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>Some small groups of people are so smart--or so funny--that they can regularly sustain an audience’s interest. For this genre of podcasting, it might seem that production is a simple as finding a snowball microphone and pressing record, but often lots of preparation and subtle editing go into it. </p>

<h2>Where do I begin?</h2>

<p>Come up with an idea and make a plan.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Who should be on the panel? What does everyone bring to it?</li>
  <li>Does the panel have a theme? What is it? </li>
  <li>Does the panel speak about the news? Or popular culture? Or academia? A particular discipline? Are a group of people helping to tell a fictional story? Where are the boundaries? </li>
  <li>Is the comedy you’re doing scripted? Or improvised? A combination? Does the comedy fall within a theme or genre? Or does it challenge themes and genres? </li>  </ul>

<p>Do some research for your panel discussion or comedy.</p>

<p>Come up with prompts or questions for your panel discussion or comedy. n the biz, this is called your <strong>“Q Line.”</strong></p>

<p>Meet as a panel or comedy group and record your performance. Before you record, make sure to confirm good sound levels. Don’t be afraid to throw out your Q Line if it’s not working or if you improvisationally come across better conversation. To be recording is to be getting your <strong>“Tape.”</strong></p>

Write your plan and record some Tape.
</div>

<p>Transcribe all your Tape. <strong><a href="https://otranscribe.com/">O Transcribe</a></strong> is a useful tool for this.</p>

<p>Review all your recordings and transcriptions, cut out the best parts, and organize them into <em>“Tracks.”</em> You might also need to write some <em>“Acts”</em> to serve as transitions. Your Acts are what you’ll use to set up or deal with your Tracks. </p>

<h2>But is this the only way to make a panel-discussion / team-comedy podcast?
</h2>

<p>No! The ways are infinite! You might find that you don’t have to--or don’t want to--edit your panel discussion at all. Getting your tape and Tracks might actually be as simple as pressing “record.”

  <ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-primary"><strong>Accessibility:</strong> How can hard of hearing users identify who is talking during the podcast? Think about including name identifiers in the transcript for clarity.</li>
