<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Podcasts often follow a similar production arc but can vary greatly based on the audience and genre of their narrative. In all likelihood, this is a podcast you are putting together for the first time. However, you have already started to build a strong foundation to develop your podcast. You have created a plan that includes a Big Idea that you want to explore, identified an audience that you want to reach, envisioned some outcomes for your production and how you want to connect with your audience, and reflected on the work that you intend to develop.</p>

<p>By clarifying all of these steps, you have started to make considerations for your work that will hopefully meet your desired intent and impact. Now, it's time to identify the stages of a podcast production and how it impacts various genres of the narrative form.</p>

<p><i>Please note that these stages are meant to be iterative and non-linear. You may flow freely from stage to stage, skip a stage, return to a previous stage, and so on.</i></p>

<br>

<h2>Stage 1: Where do I begin?</h2>
<p class="card-text">At this point, you’ve done some brainstorming, and you’ve gone through NPR’s Storytelling Project Blueprint. You probably have a good idea of what you want to make, and you are envisioning a plan that will realize your podcast.</p>

<p class="card-text">But, at this early stage, this is where you have to get deeper into your planning. As you begin, you’ll want to answer questions like these:</p>

              <p class="card-text"><ul>
                <li>Who do you want to interview? </li>
                <li>Why do you want to interview them? </li>
                <li>What do you want to talk about? </li>
                <li>Will this be a peaceful interview? Or a heated one?</li>
                <li>What equipment do I need? </li>
                <li>Do I need a sound studio space to record in? </li>
                <li>What spaces will I have to go to? Can I scout out these places to get good sound?</li>
                <li>Do I even need to interview anyone? </li>
                <li>Do I need consent and release forms for my interviewees? Do I need to tell them they are on the record? </li>
                <li>What questions will I have for my interviewees? Do I give them the questions beforehand? What do I do when we get off script?
                <li>Will I go to my interviewees? Or will they come to me?</li>
                <li>How will I make sure that I’m getting good sound when I do my interviews? </li>
              </ul></p>

  <br>

<h2>Stage 2: Conducting the recording.</h2>
  <p class="card-text">Now you’re ready to record. You might be recording only yourself, or perhaps you’ll be on a panel, conducting interviews, or out in the field, conducting investigations. No matter what or how you’re recording, though, here are some things to consider:</p>
<p class="card-text">
<ul>
    <li>Always bring back-up equipment and batteries.
      <li>If you’re interviewing people, make sure they consent to the interview. This could be done with consent forms, release forms, or the journalistic practice of being clear about what’s on the record and what’s not.  </li>
      <li>Test your sound and monitor it. Before recording, make sure your equipment is working and getting sound that will sound good in people’s ears or on speakers. (You could do a sound check with an interviewee by asking them what they ate for breakfast.) As you’re recording, if you can, ensure that your levels are strong and good and in the green. </li>
      <li>If you’re in the field, look for small rooms to interview in. Look for walls to record against. Look for any opportunity to block out or dampen competitive noise.  </li>
      <li>If you’re interviewing people, work from a “Q Line.” Your “Q Line” is your list of questions, and it can help you stay on track as you’re recording. If you feel that you have to depart from your Q Line, don’t be afraid to do so.   </li>
      <li>If you’re recording yourself, try to book a sound studio and use the best vocal mic possible. If you can’t get a sound studio, record in your closet or under a heavy blanket. Use towels and sound dampeners.  </li>
    </ul></p>

  <br>

    <h2>Stage 3: Selecting podcast assets.</h2>
    <p class="card-text">In the radio and podcast world, your “Tape” is the raw material that you recorded for your podcast. The hope is that your Tape sounds good--it’s strong, clear, and ready to be in people’s ears and on their speakers. If you have superlative Tape, these are things you’ll do with it:</p>

    <p class="card-text"><ul>
      <li>You will transcribe your Tape. This can be a long, labor intensive step, but it will help you with constructing your podcast later. There are apps that can transcribe Tape via machine learning, but they don’t always work so great. There are services that you can pay for to have people transcribe your Tape, but they can become pricey if you have hundreds of hours of Tape. They also pay horrible wages.</li>
      <li>You will select “Acts” (short for “Actuals”) from your Tape. Your Acts are the fantastic things--the amazing bits--that you select from your Tape. It is far, far easier to select your Acts and place them in a composition if you’ve transcribed your Tape.</li>
      <li>You will script and record “Tracks” to set up, explain, and explicate your Acts. “Tracks” are things that you write and record after you’ve gotten your Tape and selected your Acts. For example, a Track could be your podcast intro or outro. </li>
    </ul></p>

    <p>Aside from your Tape, Acts, and Tracks, there are other assets that you’ll need to create or find in order to make your podcast. You can always record your own music and sound effects, but if you need to find Creative Commons materials, you can go to places like these:</p>
    <p class="card-text"><ul>
      <li>https://freemusicarchive.org/</li>
      <li>http://dig.ccmixter.org/</li>
      <li>http://bbcsfx.acropolis.org.uk/</li>
      <li>https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/soundeffects</li>
      <li>https://archive.org/</li>
    </ul></p>


      <br>

      <h2>Stage 4: Edit in Audacity.</h2>
      <p class="card-text">Put everything together with Audacity--your Acts, Tracks, music, and sounds. Share the draft of your podcast with any collaborators to get feedback. Share it with workshop cohort members in Slack. Consider, reject, or incorporate feedback. Reflect on your process and the meaning of your podcast. Repeat previous steps.</p>


      <br>

        <h2>Stage 5: Finish the transcription, metadata and audio deliverables.</h2>
        <p class="card-text">Using the metadata spreadsheet in our workshop materials (participants-only), enter the metadata for all files and assets you created or used. Your complete transcript is the one you will provide for you audience. It will be a combination of your Acts, Tracks, and descriptions of any of the music and sounds you used.</p>


        <br>


          <h2 class="card-title">Step 6: Determine your own license and consider your digital safety.</h2>
            <p class="card-text"><p>Decide whether or not your podcast should have a Creative Commons designation. If so, are you providing attribution for other collaborators including crediting any CC-licensed work in your production? Also consider that you and other recordees may be vulnerable to hacking or doxing and your online safety and security could potentially be at risk.</p>

            <p>Consider securing your passwords using the <strong><a href="https://www.eff.org/dice">“diceware” method</a></strong> and using a password manager like <strong><a href="https://www.lastpass.com/business-password-manager">LastPass</a></strong>.</p>

            <p>If you Google yourself, what information do data brokers have about you? We strongly consider you to <strong><a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/remove-delete-yourself-from-the-internet/">contact data brokers</a></strong> and request they remove your publicly identifiable information.</p>

        <br>

            <h2>But is this the only way to make a podcast?
            </h2>

            <p>No! The stages above are a guide--not the rule. You might do things in a different order. For example, you might write some of your Acts before conducting your interview and writing your transcript. Or, early on, you might find music that you want to use before you even decide who you want to interview. You might find that some of these steps don’t even apply. For instance, journalists don’t always have interview subjects sign release forms because they operate under the assumption that their subjects have agreed to be on the record. </p>

              <h3 class="card-title">Have you thought about...?</h3>
              <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-primary"><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Can all users use your content? Think about users who may want to listen to your content but who are hard of hearing or deaf. Provide a transcript so they can consume what you made.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary"><strong>Preservation:</strong> You've put time and effort into your team production. Think about filling out your metadata spreadsheet and where and how you will archive your podcast (multiple locations = good!).</li>
                <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-success"><strong>Open:</strong> Have you provided attribution for works other than your own? Think about how you are incorporating content and how you intend others to use your work in the future.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-warning"><strong>Digital Identity, Safety & Privacy:</strong> Did you mention someone in your recording by name? Think about how what you do and say can be linked back to you or someone else's identity.</li>
