<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>Just one voice--your voice--can be all it takes to make a podcast. With your voice, you can tell a story, make an argument, follow a line of reasoning, or crack everyone up. </p>

<br>

<h2>Examples?</h2>

<h2>Where do I begin?</h2>

<p>Come up with an idea and make a plan.</p>
<ul>
  <li>What story do you want to tell? </li>
  <li>Who could you tell a story about? </li>
  <li>What places could you tell a story about?  </li>
  <li>Which questions haunt you, plague you, enchant you? </li>
  <li>Which arguments could you sustain for an audience?</li>
  <li>What weird ideas do you have? </li>
  <li>Have you found yourself in funny situations?</li>
  <li>What do you imagine that’s funny? </li>
  <li>What’s the punchline? What’s the set up? How long is the set up?</li>
  <li>What is a story, anyway? What does it mean to make an argument? Does comedy always have to sound the same?  </li>
    </ul>

<p>Do some research about your story, commentary, or comedy. Brainstorm ideas by way of listing, freewriting, and bubble mapping.
</p>

<p>Write your script. In the biz, this is called your <strong>“Acts.”</strong> In general, a 5-7 minute podcast will call for a 500-700 word script. </p>
<div>
<span class="badge badge-warning"> Session 2, Tier 2 Assignment</span> Write your plan, and start working on your Tracks and Acts.
</div>

<p>Record yourself reading your Acts. The unedited recording you make is called your <strong>“Tape.”</strong> </p>
<div><span class="badge badge-success"> Session 2, Tier 3 Assignment</span> Write your plan, record some Tape, and start working on your Tracks and Acts.
</div>

<p>Determine if you need music and sound design. </p>
<div><span class="badge badge-danger"> Session 3, Tier 1 Assignment</span> Have all of your Tape, including Acts and Tracks.
</div>

<p>Create, license, or find <strong><a href="https://creativecommons.org/use-remix/cc-licenses/">Creative Commons music and sounds.</a></strong></p>
<div><span class="badge badge-warning"> Session 3, Tier 2 Assignment</span> Your podcast is about 75% complete.
</div>

<p>Put everything together with Audacity--your Acts, Tracks, music, and sounds. <p>
  <div><span class="badge badge-success">Session 3, Tier 3 Assignment</span> Your podcast draft is complete.
    </div>

<p>Share the draft of your podcast and get feedback. Share it with your interview subject--or not. </p>
<div><span class="badge badge-danger">End of workshop, Tier 1 Assignment</span> You have a complete podcast episode.
  </div>

<p>Consider, reject, or incorporate feedback. Reflect on your process and the meaning of your podcast. Repeat previous steps.</p>

<p>In a spreadsheet, enter the metadata for all the files you created or used.</p>
<div><span class="badge badge-warning">End of workshop, Tier 2 Assignment</span> You have a complete podcast episode and metadata.
  </div>

<p>Finish your complete transcript. Your complete transcript is the one you will provide for you audience. It will be a combination of your Acts and descriptions of any of the music and sounds you used.</p>
<div><span class="badge badge-success">End of workshop, Tier 3 Assignment</span> You have a complete podcast episode, metadata, and a complete transcript.
  </div>

<p>Decide, as a whole, whether or not your podcast should have a Creative Commons designation. </p>

<p>If you are going to put your podcasts online, do an audit of your online safety and security. Do you have safe passwords? Consider making passwords using the <strong><a href="https://www.eff.org/dice">“diceware” method</a></strong> and using <strong><a href="https://www.lastpass.com/business-password-manager">LastPass</a></strong>. If you Google yourself, what information do data brokers have about you? <strong><a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/remove-delete-yourself-from-the-internet/">Consider contacting data brokers and requesting they remove your information.</a></strong></p>

<br>

<h2>But is this the only way to make a solo podcast?
</h2>

<p>No! You might find that by making musical compositions first, a story will come to you. Or perhaps you’ll come across some Creative Commons sounds online that jumpstart your creativity. You might think that something seems funny on the page--in your script--but once you start recording, maybe you’ll improvise and say something hilarious.</p>

  <h5 class="card-title">Have you thought about...?</h5>
  <ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-primary"><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Did you provide a complete transcript? Think about how users who may be unfamiliar with your voice or language may consume your content in a written form.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary"><strong>Preservation:</strong>Did you save multiple copies? Think about how to remain accountable for preserving your work even though you are producing this by yourself.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-success"><strong>Open:</strong> Have you reached out to others for original work? Think about how you can incorporate materials specifically developed for your production.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-warning"><strong>Digital Identity, Safety & Privacy:</strong> Have you thought about how you might be exposing others?
