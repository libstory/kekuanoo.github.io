<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>An opportunity to reflect on your workshop experience! Use this time to debrief and provide true self assessment on your podcast production, workflow, and efficiency. </p>

<h2>Where do I begin?</h2>

<p>Ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is one new thing you learned about yourself?</li>
  <li>What was the most challenging aspect of creating a podcast?</li>
  <li>As a content creator, what is one thing you wish you did differently? </li>
  <li>Did you incorporate accessibility, preservation, open access, and digital identity, safety, and privacy into your workflow? Why or why not?</li>
  </ul>

    <div><span class="badge badge-success">Post-session</span> Complete your reflection and post it to your Slack channel.</div>

  <p>Include additional thoughts and reflections related to your experience in the workshop. Consider the relationships you made with peers and with members of the Teaching Team.</p>

<h2>Is the workshop over?
</h2>

<p>No! We are coordinating a live listening party to celebrate your work. This party will have a hybrid component - feel free to join us on the Seattle campus or online via Zoom. Details will be shared in Slack.</p>
