description: Identifying the different stages and genres of your production
background: '/img/t-interview.jpg'

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Podcasts often follow a similar production arc but can vary greatly based on the audience and genre of their narrative. In all likelihood, this is a podcast you are putting together for the first time. However, you have already started to build a strong foundation to develop your podcast. You have created a plan that includes a Big Idea that you want to explore, identified an audience that you want to reach, envisioned some outcomes for your production and how you want to connect with your audience, and reflected on the work that you intend to develop.</p>

<p>By clarifying all of these steps, you have started to make considerations for your work that will hopefully meet your desired intent and impact. Now, it's time to identify the stages of a podcast production and how it impacts various genres of the narrative form.</p>

<p><i>Please note that these stages are meant to be iterative and non-linear. You may flow freely from stage to stage, skip a stage, return to a previous stage, and so on.</i></p>

<br>

<h2>Stage 1: Where do I begin?</h2>
<p class="card-text">Come up with an idea and make a plan. Consider the following for each genre type:</p>

  <h2>Stage 2: Conducting the recording.</h2>
  <p class="card-text">Do some research before you record so you can generate interesting and intriguing questions to explore with your subject or characters. In the podcast industry, this is called your <strong>“Q Line.”</strong> You can share these questions with your subject before the recording, but don't feel obligated to do so if you want a more natural reaction.</p>

  <p>Set a time and place for the recording. Before you record, make sure to confirm good sound levels in your environment. Don’t be afraid to throw out your Q Line if it’s not working or if you organically come across better conversation. This process of recording is in an effort to generate another podcast industry term called <strong>“Tape.”</strong> Tape is basically the recording assets you collect during the production process.</p>

  <p>As you finish recording your subjects, consider sharing a <strong><a href="https://www.washington.edu/research/forms-and-templates/template-consent-form-standard/">consent or release form</a></strong> that they can sign.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Is the interview in a place where you can control the sound? If so, prep.</li>
                <li>Or is it in a place that you’re unfamiliar with? If so, more prep.</li>
                <li>Is the interview on the phone? If so, <u><strong><a href="https://voice.google.com/u/0/about">Google Voice. </a></strong></u></li>

    <h4>Stage 3: Selecting podcast assets.</h4>
    <p class="card-text">Transcribe your Tape using a transcription tool or service. <strong><a href="https://otranscribe.com/">O Transcribe</a></strong> is one example of a tool that works well. Once you're done transcribing, consult your transcription to pick your <strong>“Acts.”</strong> Acts, or actualities, are the interesting parts of the recording that you’ll use in your podcast. Consider these recorded snippets as "soundbites" from your recording.</p>

    <p>You also need to write your <strong>Tracks.”</strong> Tracks are the scripted, narrated sections that help tie together your Acts. Record your Tracks.</p>

    <p>At this point, you should also determine if you need music and sound design including creating, licensing, or finding <strong><a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples">Creative Commons music and sounds.</a></strong></p>

                  <p class="card-text"><ul>

                    <li>Your acts are likely to be saved as separate sound files through reporting. Decide on an appropriate naming convention to quickly and easily locate these recorded snippets.</li></ul></p>

                    <li>Consider how you might break up your recording sessions so that snippets all have a similar sound and feel. A session recorded in the morning when your vocal chords are still warming up will sound different than later in the afternoon.</li>

      <h4>Stage 4: Edit in Audacity.</h4>
      <p class="card-text">Put everything together with Audacity--your Acts, Tracks, music, and sounds. Share the draft of your podcast with any collaborators to get feedback. Share it with workshop cohort members in Slack. Consider, reject, or incorporate feedback. Reflect on your process and the meaning of your podcast. Repeat previous steps.</p>

      <p>This is equally applicable to all genre formats.</p>

      <br>

        <h4>Stage 5: Finish the transcription, metadata and audio deliverables.</h4>
        <p class="card-text">Using the metadata spreadsheet in our workshop materials (participants-only), enter the metadata for all files and assets you created or used. Your complete transcript is the one you will provide for you audience. It will be a combination of your Acts, Tracks, and descriptions of any of the music and sounds you used. Decide, as a whole, whether or not your podcast should have a Creative Commons designation.</p>

        <p>This is equally applicable to all genre formats.</p>

        <br>


          <h2 class="card-title">Step 6: Determine your own license and consider your digital safety.</h2>
            <p class="card-text"><p>Decide, as a whole, whether or not your podcast should have a Creative Commons designation. If you are going to put your podcasts online, do an audit of your online safety and security. Do you have safe passwords? Consider making passwords using the <strong><a href="https://www.eff.org/dice">“diceware” method</a></strong> and using <strong><a href="https://www.lastpass.com/business-password-manager">LastPass</a></strong>. If you Google yourself, what information do data brokers have about you? <strong><a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/remove-delete-yourself-from-the-internet/">Consider contacting data brokers and requesting they remove your information.</a></strong></p>

        <p>At this point, you are ready to choose a podcast genre. It's likely that you will pick and choose different aspects of each genre to incorporate into your own production, but we encourage you to start with the genre that most resonates with your idea or proposal. The genres are as follows:</p>

        <br>

            <h2>But is this the only way to make an interview podcast?
            </h2>

            <p>No! The steps above are a guide--not the rule. You might do things in a different order. For example, you might write some of your Acts before conducting your interview and writing your transcript. Or, early on, you might find music that you want to use before you even decide who you want to interview. You might find that some of these steps don’t even apply. For instance, journalists don’t always have interview subjects sign release forms because they operate under the assumption that their subjects have agreed to be on the record. </p>

            <div class="card-body">
              <h5 class="card-title">Have you thought about...?</h5>
              <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-primary"><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Can all users use your content? Think about users who may want to listen to your content but who are hard of hearing or deaf. Provide a transcript so they can consume what you made.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary"><strong>Preservation:</strong> You've put time and effort into your team production. Think about filling out your metadata spreadsheet and where and how you will archive your podcast (multiple locations = good!).</li>
                <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-success"><strong>Open:</strong> Have you provided attribution for works other than your own? Think about how you are incorporating content and how you intend others to use your work in the future.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-warning"><strong>Digital Identity, Safety & Privacy:</strong> Did you mention someone in your recording by name? Think about how what you do and say can be linked back to you or someone else's identity.</li>
