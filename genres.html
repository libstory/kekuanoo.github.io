<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Podcasts often follow a similar production arc but can vary greatly based on the audience and genre of their narrative. In all likelihood, this is a podcast you are putting together for the first time. However, you have already started to build a strong foundation to develop your podcast. You have created a plan that includes a Big Idea that you want to explore, identified an audience that you want to reach, envisioned some outcomes for your production and how you want to connect with your audience, and reflected on the work that you intend to develop.</p>

<p>By clarifying all of these steps, you have started to make considerations for your work that will hopefully meet your desired intent and impact. Now, it's time to identify the stages of a podcast production and how it impacts various genres of the narrative form.</p>

<p><i>Please note that these stages are meant to be iterative and non-linear. You may flow freely from stage to stage, skip a stage, return to a previous stage, and so on.</i></p>

<h4>Stage 1: Where do I begin?</h4>
<p class="card-text">Come up with an idea and make a plan. Consider the following for each genre type:</p>

                <li>Why do you want to interview them? </li>
                <li>What do you want to talk about? </li>
                <li>Will this be a peaceful interview? Or a heated one?  </li></ul></p>

<h4 class="card-title">Step 1: What is your Big Idea?</h4>
  <p class="card-text">Describe your podcast in one memorable sentence. Consider this a statement of purpose. What is your podcast really about? You could also think of this as an "elevator pitch" but know that this idea can, and likely will, change during the workshop.</p>

<h4 class="card-title">Step 2: Who is your audience?</h4>
  <p class="card-text">Who do you intend to reach with your podcast? How do you think your audience perceives themselves?</p>

<h4 class="card-title">Step 3: What general takeaways do you want the audience to have?</h4>
  <p class="card-text">How do you want your audience to connect? What do you want them to feel? What do you want your audience to say after listening to your podcast?</p>

<h4 class="card-title">Step 4: Write your aspirational podcast review.</h4>
  <p class="card-text">Envision your ideal listener. What do they look like? Describe them. Now, envision your ideal podcast review - the 5.0 star review in your comments that gushes about your podcast. What does it say?</p>

<h4 class="card-title">Step 5: What do you think you're making?</h4>
  <p class="card-text">Now we're getting into the nitty gritty of your podcast idea. Identify your particular podcast format (interview, solo commentary, narrative stories, or hybrid) and try to provide a summary of what you think you will be making in this workshop. Think of this as a conceptual outline - not a proposal - of where you want to go in this workshop. Know that this is a draft and is meant to provide a broad representation of your podcast's characteristics. </p>

<p>At this point, you are ready to choose a podcast genre. It's likely that you will pick and choose different aspects of each genre to incorporate into your own production, but we encourage you to start with the genre that most resonates with your idea or proposal. The genres are as follows:</p>
