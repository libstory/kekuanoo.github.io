<p>Before you begin, get your recording gear in order. This could be a smartphone or USB microphone. Smartphones have access to Voice Memo (iPhone) or Audio Recorder (Android) software. You will also want to download your recording software of choice. We recommend <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a>.</p>

<p>To export an audio project as an MP3 file, you need to download and install the <a href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/faq_installing_the_lame_mp3_encoder.html">LAME MP3 Encoder</a>. You can view a tutorial for this installation on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EOR_Ub9vUM">YouTube.</a>.

<h3>Write your short script</h3>
<p>In this assignment, you need a script. Your script should include your name, your podcast name, and what your podcast is about. At this point, you can just come up with any goofy or wacky podcast concept.</p>

<h3>Record and import</h3>
<p>You can record directly in Audacity using the Record button or you can record yourself on your phone and import your recording into Audacity. Check out a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ClwSNm362E">beginners tutorial</a> or go directly to Audacity Manual to learn how to <a href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/play.html">import audio files</a> into your project.</p>

<h3>Use basic editing functions</h3>
<p>Once you have your recording imported, you can edit it using some common functions in Audacity.</p>

<p><em>Cut</em> your recording by using the <em>Selection</em> tool and the <em>Split</em> function. With the selection tool active, click on an area in your recording where you want to cut. Go to Edit --> Clip Boundaries --> Split. We suggest you learn the keyboard shortcuts for the Split function since it will be used quite often: ctrl+i or ⌘+i.</p>

<p><em>Shift</em> parts of your recording by using the <em>Time Shift</em> tool. Click and drag selections to move.</p>

<p><em>Delete</em> selections in your recording by using the <em>selection</em> tool, highlighting a section, and hitting the <em>Delete</em> key on your keyboard.

<h3>Find music</h3>
<p>At this point, you should have made some basic edits to your recording. Now, you need music to go along with your recording. Head to <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/">freemusicarchive.org</a> and find an audio track. You can browse by <em>Genre</em> to find a type of recording that best suits your needs. Download the track and drag the music file into Audacity project. Use the <em>Selection</em> and <em>Time Shift</em> tools to edit your audio track.</p>

<h3>Some editing tips</h3>
<p>Use the <em>Zoom</em> feature to manipulate finer details in your recording and audio track. Zoom options are located in View --> Zoom.</p>

<p>The <em>Envelope</em> tool allows you to adjust your sound levels according. Insert points in your audio tracks to increase or decrease volume as necessary. This will allow you to quiet your audio track so you can hear your voice recording. The Envelope tool also lets you create fade in and fade out effects for your projects.</p>

<h3>Save and export</h3>
<p>A good tip is to save your project early and often. Go to File --> Save Project. This will save a .aup (Audacity Project) file that will contain your tracks and edits. Once installed, saving an MP3 is quite easy. Go to File --> Export --> Export as MP3.</p>

<h3>Your metadata</h3>
<p>Delete the information in the pop-up box. This box is used to input metadata. Enter your own information into the metadata fields and click OK when you're ready.</p>

<p>Upload your MP3 file to your Slack channel to share it with the teaching team and your peers.</p>
